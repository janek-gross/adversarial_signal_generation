# adversarial_signal_generation
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown to produce excellent results in computer vision. In this repository it is demonstrated that authentic signals can also be generated with GANs. Sine curves of varying frequency, amplitude and offset are learned by recurrent neural networks.
